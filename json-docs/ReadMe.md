# CDR Test Documentation - json docs

This repository contains test case definitions that can be used to validate the compliance of an implementation of the API Standards and Information Security profile created for the [Consumer Data Right](https://treasury.gov.au/consumer-data-right "Treasury's Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation and the subsequent regulatory rules. 

The definitions are in json format and are validated against the `cdr-test-schema.x.x.x.json` and then used to generate the html page which is published [here](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards-testing/latest/).
The process used to generate this is available in the `testdocs-cli` maintained in this repository and published as an npm package available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cds-au/testdocs) 

## Contributing and providing feedback

The CDR Test Documentation is a concept we’d like to test with the community and welcome your feedback.  We have developed this based on our interpretation of earlier feedback received from the community to clarify ambiguity in the standards and to assist with implementation.

To provide feedback you need to raise an ‘issue’ or a ‘pull request’ on this repository in the same way you would on the DSB standards. We welcome feedback on:

 1. a request to add tests to clarify aspects of the standards that are not covered in this document; or
 2. where test cases or assertions that appear to be incorrect; or
 3. suggested improvements to the user interface or instructions on how to use this repository.

The team at DSB will address issues as they are raised and add or correct test cases as needed.

## Rules of engagement for this repository

We're committed to undertaking conversations relating to the technical standards in the open.

There are likely to be experiences and lessons everybody working in this ecosystem can learn from. Having these conversations transparently helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Consumer Data Standards repositories comply with the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/).
