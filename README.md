# Consumer Data Right Testing Documentation

This repository contains test case definitions that can be used to validate the compliance of an implementation of the API Standards and Information Security profile created for the [Consumer Data Right](https://treasury.gov.au/consumer-data-right "Treasury's Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation and the subsequent regulatory rules. 

The standards, and these test cases, are maintained by the Data Standards Body (DSB), with the Data Standards Chair as the decision maker.  The Data Standards Body is part of the [Treasury](https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/treasury/data-standards-body "Data Standards Body"). The work of standards development is conducted in consultation with the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0 "ACCC's CDR webpage") as co-regulator of the Consumer Data Right, along with the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/about-the-consumer-data-right/ "OAIC CDR webpage").

The purpose of the content in this repository is to document test case definitions that can be used to create test suite implementations that can verify that an implementation is compliant with the CDR standards.

If any test cases are missing or appear to be incorrect please raise an issue or a pull request and these will be responded to by the DSB team.
